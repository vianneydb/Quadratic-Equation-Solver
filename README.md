# Quadratic Equation Solver

This project is a simple Python program that calculates the solutions to a quadratic equation of the form:

```
axÂ² + bx + c = 0
```

It was created as part of the **NuSTEAM Summer Program 2025**.

## Features
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **Equation Display**: Shows the equation in scientific notation.
- **Real or Imaginary Roots**: Determines whether the solutions are real or complex.
- **Formatted Output**: Displays the roots clearly, including the imaginary part if necessary.
- **Loop Option**: Allow the user to solve multiple equations.

## How to Run
You can run this program either as a script or inside Jupyter Notebook.

### Option A: Run with Python
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vianneydb/quadratic-equation-solver
   cd quadratic-equation-solver
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python quadratic_solver.py
   ```

### Option B: Run in Jupyter Notebook
1. Open `quadratic_solver.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Execute the cells to interact with the program.

## Example
```text
This program calculates the solution to the Quadratic Equation: 
    ax^2 + bx + c = 0

Input the value for a: 1
Input the value for b: 2
Input the value for c: 5

Equation to solve
(1.0000e+00)x^2 + (2.0000e+00)x + (5.0000e+00) = 0

The solution is IMAGINARY and equal to:
    x1 = (-1.0000e+00) + i(2.0000e+00)
    x2 = (-1.0000e+00) + i(2.0000e+00)
```
